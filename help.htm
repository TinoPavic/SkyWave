<p>Line of Sight (LOS) range is limited by terrain to 2-10km.</p>
<p>Ground Wave (GW) range limited by terrain and ground to 10-60km.</p>
<p>SkyWave uses reflecftion from ionosphere to cover entire Earth.</p>
<p>NVIS covers from 0 to 600 km distance, 24x7.</p>
<p>Ionosphere changes all the time.</p>
<p>As propagations change, optimal frequency will change.</p>
<p>NVIS needs 3 frequencies: day, night  and noon/extended.</p>
<p>NVIS is effective from almost any site.</p>
<p>SkyWave covers much longer distances than NVIS.</p>
<p>Most antenna sites are not very good for SkyWave.</p>
<p>Obstacles and terrain often block low elevation angles.</p>
<h2>Controls Explained</h2>
<p>Latitude - geografical location for Tx</p>
<p>Month –season of the year.</p>
<p>Year –sunspot cycle progression</p>
<p>SSN –smoothed sunspot number</p>
<p>Mast –antenna height</p>
<p>Antenna – antenna type (Rx & Tx)</p>
<p>Power – transmit power</p>
<p>EL Min – minimum elevation angle for antenna site</p>
<p>Distance – distance between stations</p>
<p>Amb Noise - noise at location (rural, suburban, city)</p>
<p>Static – storms create extra noise (ITU-R P.372)</p>
<p>BW – receiver bandwidth</p>
<h2>Results Explained</h2>
<p>foF2= three critical frequencies (night, day, noon)</p>
<p>MUF= three optimal frequencies to use (night, day, noon)</p>
<p>SSN= smoothed sunspot number (solar cycle)</p>
<p>M3k= Freuency multiplier for 3000 km distance (secant law)</p>
<p>B= Incidence angle into F2 layer (secant law)</p>


<p>f = frequency in MHz</p>
<p>Eirp = efective isotropic radiated power in dBm</p>
<p>Li = isotropic Free Space Path Loss</p>
<p>Ld = attenuation in D region ib dB (DRAP)</p>
<p>Lt = Li+Ld, total isotropic path loss in dB</p>
<p>N = noise power in dBm for given Rx bandwidth (ITU-R P.372)</p>
<p>SNR = signal to noise ratio in dB, higher is better</p>
<p>SnrM = SNR during mid-day (dB)</p>
<p>SnrD = SNR during day (dB)</p>
<p>SnrN= SNR during night (dB)</p>
<p>Orange fonts= frequency marginally high</p>
<p>Red fonts= frequency too high (no reflection)</p>
<p>Minimum useful SNR is 5 dB for data, and 10 dB for voice.</p>
